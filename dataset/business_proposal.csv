Kang Tae-moo,I noticed the way you smiled. That changed everything.
Kang Tae-moo,"My calendar is full, but it’s missing you."
Kang Tae-moo,"The more I know you, the more I forget myself."
Kang Tae-moo,No one’s ever spoken to me like that… and lived.
Kang Tae-moo,"You're late. And somehow, I waited."
Kang Tae-moo,"Let’s rewrite this story, together."

Kang Tae-moo,I rehearse every word—until I see you.
Kang Tae-moo,I’ve conquered markets. I couldn’t conquer my heart.

Kang Tae-moo,Stop calling it fake. I stopped pretending long ago.
Kang Tae-moo,You’re more addictive than quarterly profits.
Kang Tae-moo,You could ruin me—and I’d thank you.
Kang Tae-moo,What kind of CEO sends flowers at midnight?
Kang Tae-moo,I made a reservation for two. Forever.
Kang Tae-moo,Being right doesn’t matter if I lose you.
Kang Tae-moo,Don’t argue. Just say you’ll stay.
Kang Tae-moo,"For the first time, the board can wait."
Kang Tae-moo,Let’s miss our next meeting. On purpose.
Kang Tae-moo,You deserve more than silence. So here’s my heart.
Kang Tae-moo,"If I fall, will you catch me—without an NDA?"
Kang Tae-moo,You laugh like you own the world. And mine.
Kang Tae-moo,I’ve seen empires crumble. But not for love.
Kang Tae-moo,I’d sign a contract just to hear your laugh.
Kang Tae-moo,You're the only part of my day that isn’t planned.
Kang Tae-moo,Let’s run away. Just for one day.
Kang Tae-moo,You taught me how to lose control.
Kang Tae-moo,You’re the only variable I welcome.
Kang Tae-moo,I’ve had enough reports. I want real answers—from you.
Kang Tae-moo,You could bankrupt my heart.
